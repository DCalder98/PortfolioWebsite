        <h3>Robotic Floor Scrubber</h3>
        <p>In my time as an engineer, I designed and fabricated several versions of a Robotic floor scrubber made to clean the floors of industrial buildings, shopping centers
            hospitals, etc. The robot was made from aluminum, steel, stainless steel, various mechanical parts, electrical sensors, etc. It was designed in SOLIDWORKS and is
            currently in market testing and will revolutionise the commercial sanitation space.
